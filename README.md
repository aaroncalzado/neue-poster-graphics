neue poster graphics (2014)
=========

Neue Poster Graphics is a on-going side project I created for myself to practice and experiment with front-end development techniques. I take popular classically designed posters from recent history and reinterpret them for today’s digital screens. This marries my first love of graphic design and my growing interest in front-end development. Enjoy!


### Inspiration

The idea for this project all started when I stumbled upon some beautifully rendered web snippets from [Jon Yablonski](http://jonyablonski.com/) and his take on the classic [Hiroshima poster by  Wim Crouwel](http://jonyablonski.com/2014/hiroshima/). You can find more on his [Codepen](http://codepen.io/jmy1138/). Another source of inspiration came from a trending post on [imgur.com](http://imgur.com/gallery/SWL87) showcasing popular movie posters brought to life with subtle animations.


### Who This Repo is For

I initally created this repo for myself to serve as a living documentation of my design process, but have left it open for the public to see. I encourage you to peruse, clone, fork, comment, and give feedback on my work. Mahalos!
